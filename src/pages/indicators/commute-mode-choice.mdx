intro: No matter where a person lives, commuting can be a challenge. And no
  matter the location in the Bay Area, residents have different options for
  getting from home to work. Some commuters walk or ride their bikes to work,
  others carpool across the Bay Bridge, and still others rely on transit. The
  choice of how to commute – or commute mode choice – affects everything from
  traffic congestion to air pollution.

  - title: Regional Performance
    subtitle: 2018 saw the share of automobile-based commuting decline in the Bay
      Area for the eighth year in a row.
    content: >-
      Regional mode shares have been changing for the first time in decades.
      While three-quarters of residents still drive to work on a typical
      workday, the share of residents making this choice has declined by over 7
      percentage points since 2000. This trend has accelerated in recent years,
      powered primarily by growth in public transit and active modes like
      walking and biking.


      Transit mode shares increased by 2 percentage points in the last decade – the first time this share has markedly increased in more than five decades. Hovering at 12 percent over the past few years, the share of Bay Area public transit commutes is at its highest level since 1970. Walking and biking to work have also become more popular, especially in San Francisco where active transportation has posted the greatest gains in recent years.
  - title: Regional Distribution
    subtitle: Shifts in regional mode choice have largely been driven by changing
      commute behaviors in four specific counties.
    content: >-
      While commuting patterns have been relatively stable over time in the
      North Bay and South Bay, this has not been the case elsewhere. In Alameda,
      Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties, the share of residents
      driving to work has dropped by four to seven percentage points since 2008.
      Many residents in these counties commute to jobs in San Francisco, where
      an economic boom has added just under 200,000 new jobs during this period.
      To avoid increasingly congested freeways and limited parking, the bulk of
      these commuters shifted to public transit – boosting BART and Caltrain
      ridership to record levels.


      While Contra Costa County has not experienced changes as dramatic as those seen in other Bay Area counties in recent years, county residents have made consistent and significant shifts in their commute choices over the long term. Since 1960, the share of auto commutes has dropped six percentage points while the share of transit commutes has increased by the same amount; this shift was due in large part to the construction and expansion of the BART system across the county.
  - title: Local Focus
    subtitle: San Francisco and inner East Bay communities lead the region in
      commuting by public transit.
    content: At 34 percent in 2018, San Francisco remains the regional leader in the
      percentage of residents who take transit to work, which includes both
      public options like Muni and BART as well as employer-provided shuttles.
      Adding in walking, bicycling and telecommuting, we find that 60 percent of
      San Franciscans get to work each day without an automobile, a strikingly
      high mode share for a U.S. city. At the same time, commuters from some
      central Bay Area cities are outpacing other large urban centers in using
      transit to get to their jobs. Residents of East Bay cities like Albany,
      Emeryville, El Cerrito, and Berkeley have transit mode shares even higher
      than much larger urban centers like San Jose and Oakland.
  - title: National Context
    subtitle: Only New York has a greater share of commuters who choose to leave the
      car at home.
    content: >-
      More than one-quarter of Bay Area residents choose non-auto modes to get
      to work, slightly more than Washington, D.C. or Chicago. Only New York,
      where just half of commuters drive alone each day, significantly
      outperforms the Bay Area in this regard. The Bay Area performs similarly
      for other non-automobile modes, ranking fourth for transit commuters,
      second for walk commuters, and first for bike commuters.


      In Miami, Atlanta, Dallas and Houston, approximately 80 percent of residents drive alone to work each day. While the data indicate substantial differences between the Bay Area and these Sunbelt metros, the reality is a bit more complex. The South Bay actually has mode shares quite similar to Miami or Atlanta, due in part to its rapid development in the era of the automobile. Meanwhile, San Francisco and other core cities have mode shares that more closely resemble New York.

  Methodology Notes:


  For the decennial Census datasets, the breakdown of auto commuters between drive alone and carpool is not available before 1980. "Other" includes bicycle, motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation. For the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year rolling average data was used for metros, region, and county geographic levels, while 5-year rolling average data was used for cities and tracts. This is due to the fact that more localized data is not included in the 1-year dataset across all Bay Area cities. Regional mode shares are population-weighted averages of the nine counties’ modal shares. "Auto" includes drive alone and carpool for the simple data tables and is broken out in the detailed data tables accordingly, as it was not available before 1980. “Transit” includes public operators (Muni, BART, etc.) and employer-provided shuttles (e.g., Google shuttle buses). "Other" includes motorcycle, taxi, and other modes of transportation; bicycle mode share was broken out separately for the first time in the 2006 data and is shown in the detailed data tables. Census tract data is not available for tracts with insufficient numbers of residents or workers.
