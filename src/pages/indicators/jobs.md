intro: If the Bay Area were a nation, its economy would rank among the top 25 in
  the world. Measured by number of jobs, our region’s economy is the
  fourth-largest among metropolitan areas in the United States – exactly in line
  with our rank by population. The Bay Area’s 4 million workers power an economy
  notable for its diversity, innovation and resilience, factors that have been
  instrumental in helping the region rebound from the Great Recession.

      The Bay Area economy has experienced and survived two bubbles in the 21st
      century – the “dot-com” technology bubble of the early 2000s and the more
      recent, real estate-based financial crisis of 2008. Since the end of the
      Great Recession, the region’s job market has recovered and continued to
      grow. Jobs have grown by at least 3 percent each year since 2012, reaching
      a new peak of over 4 million jobs in 2018. Only time will tell whether
      these trends are fleeting or the new normal.


      Between 2000 and 2010, the number of jobs in San Francisco decreased by 65,000. In recent years, the city has more than recovered, adding 184,000 jobs between 2010 and 2018 – nearly three times the number lost in the first decade of the 21st century. Santa Clara County is also experiencing an unprecedented boom, adding over 250,000 jobs in this decade after losing 180,000 jobs between 2000 and 2010. Together, these two counties account for nearly half the region’s employment – and more than 60 percent of regional job growth since 2010. In contrast, recent job growth in the North Bay counties of Solano and Marin – as well as Contra Costa County – has been significantly less robust.

  Methodology Notes:


  The California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment, by place of employment, for California counties. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates and thus reflect “annual average employment.” Employment estimates include part-time jobs. If an individual holds two wage and salaried jobs, the estimate will include both jobs. Employment estimates exclude business owners, self-employed people, unpaid workers, and private household workers. Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.\

  For measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.\

  \

  North Alameda County – Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont\
